The extras sheets have some blank elements (like signs, posts, and seedbags) so you can add your own veggies.
The "16x32" sheet contains some "dead" crops for you to replace your other crops with if your player neglects to water them or something.
The "16x16" sheet contains some weeds (and pollen particles) for you to use if your player doesn't take care of the soil maybe? Your choice!
